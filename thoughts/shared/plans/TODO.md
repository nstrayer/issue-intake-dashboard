- Add a "dump out to claude code proper" option. If the user gets into a state where they feel limited by the UI of the app there should be a button that the user can click that will then construct a prompt that is copied to the users clipboard. This prompt will allow them to continue what they're doing directly in claude code. It should referene the intake skill etc so that the user can continue their work seamlessly.
